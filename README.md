Fractal Set Generators in C

This repository contains simple programs to generate images of three famous fractal sets: Mandelbrot, Julia, and Tricorn (Mandelbar). Each program is implemented in plain C using standard libraries and outputs an image file in PPM format.
Description

    Mandelbrot Set: The classic fractal defined by iterating zn+1=zn2+czn+1=zn2+c starting at z0=0z0=0. Points in the complex plane are colored based on how quickly they escape a radius 2 boundary.

    Julia Set: Generated by fixing cc and iterating zn+1=zn2+czn+1=zn2+c from each pixel's complex coordinate.

    Tricorn Set: A lesser-known fractal where iteration uses the conjugate: zn+1=zn‾2+czn+1=zn2+c.

All programs produce PPM images that can be opened by standard viewers or converted to PNG/JPEG.
How to compile

Use gcc with the math library -lm flag:

bash
gcc -o mandelbrot mandelbrot.c -lm
gcc -o julia julia.c -lm
gcc -o tricorn tricorn.c -lm

How to run

Each program runs its fractal calculation and writes a PPM image file:

bash
./mandelbrot      # generates mandelbrot.ppm
./julia           # generates julia.ppm
./tricorn         # generates tricorn.ppm

Open the .ppm image file in an image viewer or convert with tools like ImageMagick:

bash
convert mandelbrot.ppm mandelbrot.png

Code highlights

    Uses C99's <complex.h> for clarity in complex arithmetic.

    Escape-time algorithm for fractal generation.

    Simple coloring scheme based on escape iterations.

    Straightforward image generation using the PPM format.

Customization ideas

    Modify iteration limits (MAX_ITER) to balance detail and performance.

    Change the viewport range to zoom into interesting fractal regions.

    Experiment with different complex constants c for Julia sets.

    Enhance color palettes for more visual appeal.

    Convert PPM to binary (P6) output for more efficient files.
